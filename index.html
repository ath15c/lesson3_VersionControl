                <span class="text-muted">What is a version control system (VCS)?</span>
            </h3>
            <p class="lead">Version Control, also known as revision control or source control, is a system that records changes to a file over time so that you can recall specific versions later on. The Version Control System that we will be using in this class is GitHub. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control that is most commonly used for computer code. It offers many features including distributed version control, source code management, and access control. GitHub is also known for its collaboration features like bug tracking, feature requests, and task management.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Advantages of using version control systems</span>
            </h3>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are extremely helpful for developers. They keep the revisions made by the user organized by storing the changes in a central repository. This allows the users to collaborate more easily. They can download a new version, make changes, and upload the newest version giving every user the ability to see these new changes, download them, and contribute their own work. VCS can also be helpful in the case that you lose your work. Repositories like GitHub store the same code that you have in your local repository so if your code disappears, you can restore the exact same code from your remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why do we use local and remote repositories?</span>
            </h3>
            <p class="lead">The purpose of a remote repository is to share your code with the world and give them the opportunity to read it or edit it, if they so choose. In our case, our remote repository is GitHub. The local repository, in our case, is the saved code on our computer. Many people utilize GitHub by backing up their code from their local repository onto their remote repository on GitHub.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Git Commands: commit</span>
            </h3>
            <p class="lead">The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. Before running the "git commit" command, you have to specifically identify the changes that you want to include in the commit. To mark the changes that you want included, use the "git add" command. Using the "git commit" command doesnâ€™t actually place your code into the remote repository, it only saves the new commit in the local git repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Git Commands: push</span>
            </h3>
            <p class="lead">The "push" command is used to push commits made on your local branch to your remote repository. The "git push" command takes two arguments to work correctly. The first is a remote name and the second is a branch name. A remote is basically the address of a cloned repository. Most commonly, you would use "git push origin master" to push your local changes to your online (remote) repository. Origin would be the remote name and master would be the branch name. This is the default method to push a commit to your remote repository.</p>
